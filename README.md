# Hi there, I'm Ivan RodrÃ­guez Restrepo ðŸ‘‹

Welcome! I'm a bilingual (English/Spanish) **Marketing Strategist and Data Analyst** blending business intelligence, digital marketing, and data storytelling to drive measurable results. With a foundation in marketing strategy and hands-on experience using Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI, I'm passionate about turning complex data into clear, actionable insights that accelerate decision-making and growth.
Over the past six years, Iâ€™ve collaborated with 300+ brands, delivering high-impact solutions in e-commerce, digital campaigns, and product launch strategy.

## ðŸ”­ Current Focus

I'm currently enhancing my expertise in:

- **R and Python for data analysis and automation**
- **Data modeling, ETL, and predictive analytics**

## ðŸŒ± Ongoing Projects

**Image Dataset for AI & Computer Vision**

Iâ€™m curating a structured, high-quality dataset of 1,000+ white-background product images, captured through years of consulting at IDR Studios. The goal is to make the dataset AI-ready for use in computer vision and generative AI applications. Key features include:

- Detailed metadata and classification  
- Image embeddings using pre-trained vision models  
- Optimized formats for training, testing, and fine-tuning AI models  
- Future applications in visual search, product matching, and retail AI tools

This project bridges my creative marketing background with growing expertise in data engineering and machine learning infrastructure.
